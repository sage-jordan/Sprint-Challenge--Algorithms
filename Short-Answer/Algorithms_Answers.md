#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) This is O(n), because it loops as many times as n until a is n^3


b) This code is O(n). It loops n times, and does 2-3 things inside this loop. ( Does `while` count as a step? )


c) I believe this one is also O(n), because it recursively loops until n reaches 0

## Exercise II
